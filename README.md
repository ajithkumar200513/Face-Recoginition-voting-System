# Face-Recoginition-voting-System
A Smart Online Voting System built using Python, OpenCV, and Scikit-learn that uses facial recognition (KNN algorithm) for voter authentication and provides real-time statistical insights into election results


# 🗳️ Smart Online Voting System

A Smart Online Voting System using facial recognition to authenticate users and ensure secure, fair voting. This project is developed using Python, OpenCV, Scikit-learn, and leverages the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) machine learning algorithm for face recognition. It also provides real-time visual statistical results such as bar charts and pie charts to display the ongoing election outcome.

## ✅ Features

- 🔐 **Face Recognition Authentication** using KNN algorithm.
- 🗳️ **Secure Voting System** – one person, one vote.
- 📊 **Real-Time Statistical Results** – includes pie charts, bar graphs, and vote percentages.
- 💾 Voter face data management and training set generation.
- 🧠 Uses **Scikit-learn** for KNN model training.
- 👁️ Built with **OpenCV** for image processing.
